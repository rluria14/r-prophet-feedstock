  summary: Implements a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model
    where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus
    holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects
    and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts
    in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
